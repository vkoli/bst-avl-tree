# bst-avl-tree

## CS435 Spring 2020 Project 1 <br><br>

An implementation and comparison of Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees. <br>

AVL Tree is represented by: 
* AVLNode.java --> representation of a Node in an AVL Tree, includes balance factor variable
* AVLTree.java --> Iterative functions: insert, delete, findMin, findMax, findNext, findPrev

BST Tree is represented by: 
* BSTNode.java --> representation of a Node in an BST Tree, does not include the balance factor
* BSTTree.java --> BST operations are implemented both iteratively and recursively

Main.java
- Driver class
- Includes code for testing BST and AVL Functions
- Comparison between BST and AVL Trees
